# OldAgeHome
Web + Mobile App for management of remote oldage homes

## Concept:
Traditional old age homes are localized in one place where discarded senior citizens live together. That was a nice concept. However, a lot of people - especially in countries like India - are not able to utilize the facility because of the social stigma associated. These people battling this stigma are let to suffocate alone, in a family that does not have enough time for them.

This product is meant to create a virtual old age home, that caters to oldies in middle class families, who do not have enough scope for life.

## Components
Primary component of this application is a mobile app - which is the prized possession of almost every Indian today. These people can potentially make a lot of friends on the social media. However, most of the social media is targetted for youngsters. So they are not able to navigate it easily. Also, a lot of them feel it is risky because of the hue and cry over privacy on platforms like facebook.

We plan a custom social media application targetted for such senior citizens. 

## Product Features
